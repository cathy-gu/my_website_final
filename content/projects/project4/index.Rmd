## Background

In the following. I will explore whether the mean IMDB rating for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton are the same or not.

## Load the data

```{r load-movies-data}

movies <- read_csv(here::here("data", "movies.csv"))
glimpse(movies)

```

## Reproduce the above graph

```{r}

selected_directors <- movies %>%
  
  select(director, rating) %>%
  
  filter(director == "Steven Spielberg" | director == "Tim Burton") %>%
  
  group_by(director) %>%
  
  summarize(avg = mean(rating), 
            sd = sd(rating), 
            count = n(),
            tstat = qt(0.975, count-1),
            se = sd/sqrt(count),
            lower_ci = avg - tstat*se, 
            upper_ci = avg + tstat*se) 

selected_directors %>%
  
  kable() %>%
  
  kable_classic()

```

```{r}

# Selecting Spielberg and Burton

selected_directors <- movies %>% 
  
  filter(director == "Steven Spielberg" | director == "Tim Burton") %>% 
  
  group_by(director) %>% 
  
  summarise(
    mean = mean(rating),
    sd = sd(rating),
    count = n(),
    se = sd / sqrt(count),
    tstat = qt(0.975, count - 1),
    lower_ci = mean - tstat * se,
    upper_ci = mean + tstat * se) 

# Reproducing the plot

ggplot(selected_directors, aes(
                            x = mean,
                            y = reorder(director, mean))) +

# Adding area where confidence intervals overlap
  
  geom_rect(xmin = 7.27,
            xmax = 7.33,
            ymin = 0,
            ymax = 10,
            fill = "grey",
            aes(alpha = 0.5)) +
  
# Adding points to plot the mean
  
  geom_point(aes(
            color = director),
            size = 4) +
  
  
# Adding confidence interval error bars

  geom_errorbar(aes(
                    xmin = lower_ci,
                    xmax = upper_ci,
                    colour = director,
                    fill = director),
                    width = 0.2,
                    size = 1.5) +
  
# Adding mean labels
  
  geom_text(aes(
            label = round(mean, 2)),
            size = 5,
            hjust = 0.4,
            vjust = -1) +
  
# Setting fill colors
  
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#FA8072", "#48D1CC")) +
  
# Adding confidence interval labels
  
  geom_text(aes(
                label = round(lower_ci, 1.4)),
                hjust = 4,
                vjust = - 1) +
  
  geom_text(aes(
                label = round(upper_ci, 1.4)),
                hjust = - 4,
                vjust = - 1) +
  
# Adding theme
  
  theme_bw() +
  
# Removing legend
  
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  
# Adding titles to plot and axes
  
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold")) +
  
  labs(title = "Do Spielberg and Burton have the same IMDB ratings?",
       subtitle = "95% confidence intervals overlap",
       x = "Mean IMDB ratings",
       y = "") +
  
# Adjusting size
  
  theme(aspect.ratio=3.5/5) 

```

## Hypothesis test

Now I will perform a hypothesis test with the hypotheses being:

Null hypothesis: There is no difference between the mean ratings for Spielberg and Burton

Alternative hypothesis: There is a difference between the mean ratings for Spielberg and Burton


```{r}
selected_directors <- movies %>%
  select(director, rating) %>%
  filter(director == "Steven Spielberg" | director == "Tim Burton")
t.test(rating ~ director, selected_directors)
```

> The above t test shows that we have to reject the null hypothesis as the p-value is equal to 0.01 and hence < 0.05.

```{r}
set.seed(1234)

# Running a simulation with the infer package

hypothesis_test <- selected_directors %>%
  
  specify(rating ~ director) %>%
  
# Null hypothesis is that there is no difference between the two population means
  
  hypothesise(null="independence") %>%
  
  generate(reps=1000,
           type="permute") %>%
  
# Obtaining difference in means with bootstrap function
  
  calculate(stat="diff in means",
            order = c("Steven Spielberg","Tim Burton"))

difference_ratings <- selected_directors %>%
  
  specify(rating ~ director) %>%
  
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("Steven Spielberg","Tim Burton"))

# Get p_Value through infer package

p_value <- hypothesis_test %>%
  
  get_p_value(obs_stat = difference_ratings,
              direction = "both")

kbl(p_value, 
    col.names=c("p-value"),
    caption="Null distribution") %>%

kable_classic()

```

> The simulation-based test shows again that the p-value is < the alpha value. Hence, we reject the null-hypothesis.
